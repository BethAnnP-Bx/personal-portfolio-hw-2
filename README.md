# Personal-Portfolio-HW-2

Created an MVP Personal Portfolio through these methods:

- Created repository in Github
- Identified github pages were not published, and my folder structure after many commits, was not correct. I deleted the first repo and cloned my work into the new repo.
- Developed a personal porfolio to be a minimally viable product to the mock up provided and with responsive layout that adopts to viewport.
- Added alt text to image.
- Added resume, linkedin for contact me, work link to navigate to projects and programs, ensure the about me linked to a decription of me.
- Added hover and zoom on the applications so that it was larger sized than other text on the page, per the assignment.

## User Stor

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
